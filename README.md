# JsonEx

JsonEx is a JSON-based customizable expression syntax that allows you to define
and execute logic securely. By controlling the set of available built-in
functions, it provides the flexibility for a wide range of tasks, from simple
calculations to more advanced logic, all within a safe execution environment.

JsonEx enables secure dynamic logic for use cases like automation,
configuration, and rule execution. Its customizable function set allows for
flexible, condition-driven logic tailored to the applicationâ€™s needs.

## Syntax

### Expression

An expression can be a basic expression (`string | number | boolean | null`) or
a functinal expression (calling a function).

When evaluating, a basic expression would result itself, yet a functional
expression would be further evaluated its result.

### Write the JSON

For a basic expression, just simply put it as is.

```json
"foo"
```

```json
3.1415926
```

```json
true
```

```json
null
```

They would be evaluated as they are.

For a functional expression, it should be surrounded by `[]`. Inside the `[]`,
the first element should be the function name, then it is followed by the
function arguments.

```json
["add", 1, 1]
/* evaluated value: 2 */
```

### Default Functions

Check [`./src/default-fns`](./src/default-fns) for default functions.

Some special functions:

- Use `def` function to define a custom function. Inside the defined function
  body, a `args` function is provided, which returns the list of arguments that
  passed into the defined function when it is called. If a `index` argument is
  given to `args` function, it returns the specific argument at that index
  instead.
- Use `$` function to define a sequence of expressions, which evaluates its
  arguments one by one and return the last evaluated value.
- Use `@` function to run another JSON file, which is useful to load custom
  functions in another JSON file.

## Usage (with Deno)

The evaluator can be run by either

- clone the repo and run

  ```sh
  deno run -A src/cli.ts
  ```
- or

  ```sh
  deno task start src/cli.ts
  ```

- or directly run with the URL

  ```sh
  deno run -A https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeanWong24/json-ex/refs/heads/main/src/cli.ts
  ```

For example, to evaluate
[`./examples/fibonacci/main.json`](./examples/fibonacci/main.json) with default
function set:

```sh
deno task start ./examples/fibonacci/main.json
```
